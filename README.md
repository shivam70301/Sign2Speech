# Sign2Speech

## Overview

**Sign2Speech** is a real-time application that seamlessly converts sign language alphabets into spoken audio and on-screen text. Designed with accessibility and inclusivity in mind, the project empowers individuals with hearing or speech impairments to communicate more easily with the broader world by leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision and audio technologies.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** Instantly recognizes sign language alphabets using a camera feed.
- **On-Screen Display:** Shows the detected alphabet or word live on the interface for immediate feedback.
- **Speech Synthesis:** Converts recognized signs into clear, natural-sounding audio output to facilitate spoken communication.
- **Multi-Platform Architecture:** Integrates core functionality using components built with Python (for processing and backend), Dart/Flutter (for the cross-platform app), and C++/Swift (for performance-critical modules).
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Simple and friendly front end for both desktop and mobile users[1].

## How It Works

1. **Camera Input:** The user presents hand signs (alphabets) in front of the camera.
2. **Sign Detection:** Advanced machine learning models process the live video stream to identify the displayed alphabet.
3. **Text Output:** The recognized alphabet or word appears instantly on the device screen.
4. **Audio Output:** Simultaneously, the system uses text-to-speech technology to audibly "say" the recognized sign.

## Use Cases

- Facilitating communication for individuals who use sign language as their primary means of expression.
- Real-time classroom or work environments that require sign language interpretation.
- Enhancing accessibility in public service kiosks, healthcare settings, and customer service counters.
